# **1.Notice Bar**

![](../assets/notice-1.png)

We have added a small notice section. The content comes from the prismic. You can show and hide this notice from your prismic content.
![](../assets/prismic-notice.png)You can find the above settings in the common content in your prismic data. To check this noticebar implementation head over to the below file,

```
components/header/noticebar/noticebar.tsx
```

First we have tested the prismic data in our graphql playground
